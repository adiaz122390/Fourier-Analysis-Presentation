# Fourier-Analysis-Presentation

Fourier Analysis represents a change in the way math was viewed in the 1800's. Joeseph Fourier, a bright prodigal mathematician, made a proposal that shocked the mathematical community. His proposal was a solution to the heat equation, a complicated equation that had no solution at the time. In this proposal he suggested that an infinite amount of sine and cosine waves can be summed to give an exact representation of another function. This was the birth of analysis, a rigorous transformation of the calculus that had been used since it's inception by Newton and Liebniz.

This project was of special importance to me. I originally presented this topic and the idea of using the Fourier Transform in signal analysis for my honors capstone project for physics. This presentation was my first deep dive into math and it's ubiquity. Since then, I made a radical transition from being an engineering major to a math major.

This presentation is composed of two concepts, 1) the Fourier Series and how to calculate Fourier Coefficients, and 2) the Fourier Transform and it's application in analytics. I've used this as a learning project for my fellow peers and in conjunction with another presentation more appropriate for children.
